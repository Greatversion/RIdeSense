# Flutter Map Application

A Flutter application that displays a map using Google Maps, allows users to search for locations, view their current location, and display markers with custom info windows.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Utilizes the Google Maps Flutter plugin to display interactive maps.
- **Location Search**: Users can search for a location and view it on the map.
- **Current Location**: Automatically detects and displays the user's current location.
- **Custom Info Windows**: Displays titles for markers without requiring user interaction.
- **Map Type Toggle**: Allows users to switch between different map types (normal, satellite, terrain, hybrid).

## Technologies Used

- Flutter
- Google Maps Flutter Plugin
- Geolocator
- Geocoding
- Provider

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-map-app.git
   cd flutter-map-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Google Maps API**:
   - Obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the Maps SDK for Android and iOS.
   - Add your API key to the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:
     ```xml
     <meta-data
         android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
         android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
     ```

   - For iOS, add the API key to your `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file:
     ```swift
     import UIKit
     import Flutter
     import GoogleMaps // Import Google Maps

     @UIApplicationMain
     class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
         GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY") // Provide API Key
         return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the application, and you will see the map loaded with your current location.
- You can search for any location using the search feature, and it will place a marker on the map.
- Tap the marker to see additional details, or view the title of the location directly above the marker.

## Customizing the Application

- **Change Initial Position**: Modify the `_initialPosition` variable in the `MapDisplayScreen` class to change the default map location.
- **Marker Titles**: Customize the marker titles in the `_buildCustomInfoWindow` method based on your requirements.
